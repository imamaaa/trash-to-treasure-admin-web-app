# Trash to Treasure - Admin Web App  

## Overview  
The **"Trash to Treasure" Admin Web App** is part of my **Final Year Project (FYP)** that aims to tackle **low recycling rates and poor waste management** through an **AI-powered trash classification and incentivized rewards system**.  

Pakistan generates approximately **49.6 million tons of solid waste annually**, yet **only 3% of plastic waste is recycled locally**. The **lack of proper waste segregation** and **insufficient incentives** result in **mixed waste**, making recycling efforts inefficient.  

### **How This System Works**  
This system provides a **digital solution** that integrates:  
- **AI-based Trash Classification Module** → Classifies waste types for better segregation  
- **Smart Bin** → Displays QR codes/PINs after users dispose of waste  
- **Client Mobile App** → Allows users to scan QR codes, track recycling history, and earn points  
- **Client Web App** → Enables users to log into their accounts, track points, and manage rewards  
- **Admin Web App** → Used by platform administrators to manage users, shops, and the point system  

**This repository contains only the Admin Web App used for system administration.**

## Features  
- **User Account Management** → Admins can manage user accounts, permissions, and access control.
- **Point System Management** → Admins can set point values, monitor point distribution, and configure rewards.
- **Shop & Cafe Management** → Admins approve registrations of partner businesses and ensure compliance.
- **Feedback Management** → Admins receive and review user feedback to improve the platform.  

For **detailed methodology and implementation**, refer to the **FYP Report (`S24_008_D_TrashtoTreasure.pdf`)**.
